DLC Drills have a higher contrast coating for better visibility of drill depth markings
The added drill color coding makes identification and organization of drills easier. The color-coding matches the surgical kit and the implant vial label
The new short DLC drills have longer flutes as well as 11.5mm and 13mm depth marks to enable placement of implants up to 13mm in length
The Diamond-Like Carbon Coating (DLC) is a coating process that enhances the wear resistance of biomedical components while maintaining low friction and bioinertial properties
Within the DLC drill line, there are four different hub sizes that vary by diameter to minimize the hub width and reduce the possibility of interference
The DLC drill hub provides a secure fit for Implant Direct Drill Stops to attach, aligning with preset Drill Stop diameters
DLC drills are indicated for drilling up to 30 osteotomies per drill at a recommended maximum of 1200RPM
The overall length of the long DLC Drills (6-16mmL) is 36.6mm and the overall length of the short DLC Drills (6-13mmL) is 30.6mm

DLC Drills have a higher contrast coating for better visibility of drill depth markings
The added drill color coding makes identification and organization of drills easier. The color-coding matches the surgical kit and the implant vial label
The new short DLC drills have longer flutes as well as 11.5mm and 13mm depth marks to enable placement of implants up to 13mm in length
The Diamond-Like Carbon Coating (DLC) is a coating process that enhances the wear resistance of biomedical components while maintaining low friction and bioinertial properties
Within the DLC drill line, there are four different hub sizes that vary by diameter to minimize the hub width and reduce the possibility of interference
The DLC drill hub provides a secure fit for Implant Direct Drill Stops to attach, aligning with preset Drill Stop diameters
DLC drills are indicated for drilling up to 30 osteotomies per drill at a recommended maximum of 1200RPM
The overall length of the long DLC Drills (6-16mmL) is 36.6mm and the overall length of the short DLC Drills (6-13mmL) is 30.6mm

Implant Direct,D5.1C,Implant Direct,D5.1C,5.1mmD DLC Straight Drill - Long,"D5.1C
DLC Drills have a higher contrast coating for better visibility of drill depth markings
The added drill color coding makes identification and organization of drills easier. The color-coding matches the surgical kit and the implant vial label
The new short DLC drills have longer flutes as well as 11.5mm and 13mm depth marks to enable placement of implants up to 13mm in length
The Diamond-Like Carbon Coating (DLC) is a coating process that enhances the wear resistance of biomedical components while maintaining low friction and bioinertial properties
Within the DLC drill line, there are four different hub sizes that vary by diameter to minimize the hub width and reduce the possibility of interference
The DLC drill hub provides a secure fit for Implant Direct Drill Stops to attach, aligning with preset Drill Stop diameters
DLC drills are indicated for drilling up to 30 osteotomies per drill at a recommended maximum of 1200RPM

DLC Drills have a higher contrast coating for better visibility of drill depth markings
The added drill color coding makes identification and organization of drills easier. The color-coding matches the surgical kit and the implant vial label
The new short DLC drills have longer flutes as well as 11.5mm and 13mm depth marks to enable placement of implants up to 13mm in length
The Diamond-Like Carbon Coating (DLC) is a coating process that enhances the wear resistance of biomedical components while maintaining low friction and bioinertial properties
Within the DLC drill line, there are four different hub sizes that vary by diameter to minimize the hub width and reduce the possibility of interference
The DLC drill hub provides a secure fit for Implant Direct Drill Stops to attach, aligning with preset Drill Stop diameters
DLC drills are indicated for drilling up to 30 osteotomies per drill at a recommended maximum of 1200RPM
The overall length of the long DLC Drills (6-16mmL) is 36.6mm and the overall length of the short DLC Drills (6-13mmL) is 30.6mm

Course Location:  UNLV School of Dental Medicine, 1700 W Charleston Blvd., Building D, Second Floor, Las Vegas, NV 89102In today’s dental practice, technology can play a big role. We have advanced diagnostic and treatment planning methods as well as surgical guides that could simplify implant placement. Therefore, making it easier for a general dentist to start placing dental implants.A common obstacle in our implant practice is the presence of a tooth that needs to be extracted. Without the proper training, tooth extractions could be very frustrating for the patient, the dentist, and even the staff. Most extractions performed in dental school were “simple” extractions. Anything complicated was reserved for the Oral Surgery or the Periodontics residents.  There are a lot of patients with missing teeth. Many started with a tooth that was extracted and a grafted site, ultimately leading to the patient becoming comfortable with their edentulous area. A tooth that is properly extracted and immediately replaced with a dental implant could greatly benefit the patient and the dental practice. This is the bread and butter of my implant practice, and it can be your bread and butter too.",,,Implants,,https://store.implantdirect.com/us/en/edu-111922,,https://store.implantdirect.com/us/en/media/catalog/product/placeholder/default/ID-no-image.png
