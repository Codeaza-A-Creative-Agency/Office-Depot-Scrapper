The motor-driven lifting table significantly simplifies the charging of the high-temperature furnace. The all-around heating of the cylindrical furnace chamber ensures a very even temperature uniformity.The high-temperature bottom loading furnaces are additionally equipped with a drying as well as a forced cooling function. For residual drying, the oven remains open gapwise during heating up to a defined temperature and thus ensures reliable removal of moisture. For accelerated cooling, the furnace is automatically opened step by step under program control. Depending on the batch used and the saggars, these high-temperature furnaces can achieve total cycle times of less than two and a half hours. The furnaces can be individually programmed for all recommended sintering curves of all zirconia manufacturers.• Tmax 1650 °C• Furnace chamber with a volume of 1 or 2 liters, table with large floor space• High-quality heating elements made of molybdenum disilicide offer very good protection against chemical interaction between charge and heating elements• Appealing, double-walled stainless steel housing• Exclusive use of insulation materials without categorization according to EC Regulation No. 1272/2008 (CLP)• Outstanding temperature uniformity due to all-round furnace chamber heating• Scope of delivery includes a starter set for charging on one level, additional levels as additional equipment• Precise, motorized toothed belt drive of the table with button operation• Forced cooling function with automatic, step-by-step opening from a preset temperature• Exhaust air vent in the roof• Type S thermocouple• Controller P480 with memory for 50 programs, 2 sample programs• Usable for sintering blanks of all leading manufacturers• Drying function: When starting the program the table will be driven in drying position and closes automatically at 500 °C• Defined application within the constraints of the operating instructions• NTLog Basic for Nabertherm controller: recording of process data with USB-flash driveAs one of the world's largest furnace manufacturers, Nabertherm has many years of experience in the design and manufacture of standardized and customer-specific control systems.

The motor-driven lifting table significantly simplifies the charging of the high-temperature furnace. The all-around heating of the cylindrical furnace chamber ensures a very even temperature uniformity.The high-temperature bottom loading furnaces are additionally equipped with a drying as well as a forced cooling function. For residual drying, the oven remains open gapwise during heating up to a defined temperature and thus ensures reliable removal of moisture. For accelerated cooling, the furnace is automatically opened step by step under program control. Depending on the batch used and the saggars, these high-temperature furnaces can achieve total cycle times of less than two and a half hours.

Chairside Solutions,Aidite Biomic Stain & Glaze Gum Kit,Chairside Solutions,,Aidite Biomic Stain & Glaze Gum Kit,"Product DescriptionThis new kit of Biomic Gum provides 6 kinds of pink color, which can be used together to imitate different colored gums. Also one color shade guide and one 3D Brush are included. With the use of them, you can complete higher-level staining and obtain a more ideal bionic aesthetic experience.Simple Aesthetics for GumDue to the large number of restorations made when doing implants, in addition to the aesthetics of the crown part, the ""pink"" aesthetics of the gums are also indispensable. In order to enable dental technicians to quickly produce bionic gum color with zirconia materials, Aidite has launched a new Biomic gum color paste kit. The product is designed to allow dental technicians to use a fast, simple method to finish their work, achieving a restoration that replicates natural gums.Processing TipsLow-temperature powder can be mixed into Glaze-F to form a special paste. If it is too thick, it can be mixed with coloring liquid 1.If you want to make a special color 3D paste, just mix the powder with 3D Natural, and add the coloring liquid 2 toadjust the consistency as needed for easy operation.All the surfaces of all-ceramic crowns can be adjusted with 3D paste.The 3D pastes contain porcelain powder, which will increase the thickness after sintering, and can be used toincrease theocclusal contact area, abutment surface and incisal length.When micro-cutting the full crown, 3D paste can be directly used after dyeing to achieve the same effect as porcelain.To reduce the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be reduced to 715 ℃.To improve the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be increased to 750 ℃.You can increase or decrease the surface brightness of the restoration by manual polishing after glazing.Under normal operation, white zirconia does not need to use pink coloring liquid for internal dyeing treatment, and can be directly dyed with the gum suit.If you need strong chroma, you can use Pink R or Pink 5 to cover the surface of the framework first.Can be used to enhance the color of gum after porcelain and repair surface defects.2D paste：Pink5/PinkR3D paste：Pink1/Pink2/Pink3/Pink4/3DN/3DVLiquid ：Coloring Liquid 1/Coloring Liquid 2Accessory：3D Brush/6Shades Guide",,1,,,https://www.chairsidesolutions.com/shop/p/aidite-biomic-stain-glaze-gum-kit,,"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642710707202-F09LVT1OF0MGHI7UGXMQ/87.png,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642710707189-G88GSN3YFSKBATCN5XAI/88.png,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642710707207-9Z7NK00MGAPDM115EG33/89.png,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642710707175-LUYK497875DFZ9551D1A/90.png"

Chairside Solutions,NK Optik Otoflash G171-6 Curing Unit with Nitrogen Port,Chairside Solutions,,NK Optik Otoflash G171-6 Curing Unit with Nitrogen Port,"Flash-curing device for rapid and reliable curing of light-curable resins.The Otoflash is a light polymerization chamber for the hardening/curing of light curing resins for jewelry, dental, and otoplastic applications. Two photoflash lamps at the bottom of the curing chamber operate in a work mode with a frequency of 10 flashes per second. The photo-flash lamps produce a very intensive light radiation in a spectrum from 300 up to 700 nm. Because of this intensive light radiation, a better hardening of the materials is possible, resulting in materials with good physical values and reduced content of residual monomer versus using other lamp types with a different light emitting spectrum.The G171 Otoflash includes protective gas appliance (N2). This prevents any oxygen inhibition on the surfaces so that they're cured completely non-stick without any need to remove or wipe away the inhibition layer.Product Specs:Dimensions of Polymerisation Chamber: approx. 120 x 120 x 50 mmNumber of light sources: 2 flashbulbs à 100 WRated Voltage: 100, 117, 230 volt AC, adjustable by switchRated Frequency: 50 / 60 HzPower Input: 250 WSpectral Distribution: 280-700 nm, maximum between 400 and 500 nmAverage Flash Power: 200 WFlash Frequency: 10 flashes per secondDigital Timer: Adjustable from 1 to 9,999 flashesDimensions: 12"" x 12"" x 6""Weight: approx. 17 lbs",,1,,,https://www.chairsidesolutions.com/shop/p/nkoptikotoflash,,"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642609453177-NT8FG8OER7B56J5231A7/17.png,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dfed97dd4164389e8be7cf/1642609453177-9FRYTRMDGS6TRNBR3N0M/18.png"
