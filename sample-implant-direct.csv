Many dentists quickly realize our profession and their life is very different from what they expected. Instead of a rewarding career helping others and honing our clinical skills, we find ourselves just trying to survive. Drowning in debt, afraid of making poor practice ownership decisions, we have few options and little control. We ask around and start to understand that the mature dentists in our community have few answers, many have become discouraged, their future uncertain and time limited. This course is a blueprint for the courageous. Those who want to take themselves and their team and create the practice of their dreams. This course is for practice owners, future practice owners, spouses, and all dental team members.More Information Passport ApprovedYes CE Credits14 CE Surgical or NonSurgical-Non-Surgical",,,Implants,,https://store.implantdirect.com/us/en/catalog/product/view/id/3722/s/lifestyle-and-legacy-october-21-22-2022-las-vegas-nv/category/117/,,https://store.implantdirect.com/us/en/media/catalog/product/cache/04d236b1062a66fda28e671d2b02aa59/l/i/lifestyle-_-legacy_2.jpg
