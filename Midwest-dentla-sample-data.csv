MW Dental,VixWin Platinum Imaging Software,Gendex Dental Systems,,VixWin Platinum Imaging Software," Product Description Gendex's VixWin™ Platinum combines cutting edge tools and powerful features that yield crisp, clearly detailed images within an environment of accelerated workflow. Intuitive icons and toolbars in VixWin™ Platinum allow users to quickly identify and access tools for image applications, reducing task times and increasing productivity. While all dental professionals benefit from this adaptable interface, new users will especially appreciate a short learning curve that makes the adoption of digital imaging an enjoyable experience. In addition, VixWin Platinum puts dental professionals in full command of their radiographs with a breakthrough component called the Optimizer. This diagnostic tool’s progressive filters and processing algorithms improve image quality, leading to highly defined X-rays. With Optimizer settings, dental professionals can easily perfect their radiographs for enhanced diagnostics. This release further elevates the proven flexibility of VixWin software, as dental team members benefit from innovative, image-capturing features. For example, VixWin Platinum still allows full customization of mounts, yet users may now set the capture sequence for each series. For greater convenience, a “Quick Mount Selector” allows for rapid mount selection, while “Auto-advance” easily guides a clinician through a series of options, and “Auto-rotation” places each image in the correct orientation. VixWin Platinum’s advantages of flexibility and time management are also augmented by the all-new VxLink module. With just one click of the VxLink, Platinum users are connected to the major practice management programs used by more than 85 percent of today’s dentists.

MW Dental,Soprolife Intra-oral Camera and Caries Detector,Acteon,,Soprolife Intra-oral Camera and Caries Detector," Product Description SOPROLIFE will allow you to see what was once invisible to your eyes. It offers you the ability to detect tooth decay at different stages of its development, thus allowing you to determine the most adequate treatment.

The auto fluorescence technology in SOPROLIFE will allow you to detect occlusal or interproximal decay – even in its earliest stages – which is often missed by X-rays. SOPROLIFE also allows you to differentiate healthy from infected tissue in order to excavate only the tissue which is diseased. SOPROLIFE features 3 modes to optimize your dental practice! • Diagnosis aid mode – shows the characterization of lesions at different clinical stages without losing consistency • Treatment aid mode – images will show a differentiation of pre-operative healthy tissue versus diseased tissue • “DAYLIGHT” mode – allows the dentist to use SOPROLIFE as a white light intra-oral camera to produce high-quality images Contact Us MFG: Acteon ",,,Equipment,,https://www.mwdental.com/equipment/soprolife-intra-oral-camera.html,,https://www.mwdental.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/o/soprolife.jpg
