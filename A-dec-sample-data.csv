A-dec,icx,A-dec,icx,ICX and ICX Renew. Simple. Effective. Affordable. (U.S. Only)," ICX and ICX Renew. Simple. Effective. Affordable. (U.S. Only) Patients trust that the water you're using in their oral cavity is of the highest quality. To ensure this, dental unit waterlines must be carefully and consistently maintained. The A-dec line of ICX products helps simplify your waterline cleaning routine. ICX waterline treatment tablets and new ICX Renew waterline shock treatment work together to eliminate buildups of odor-causing, foul-tasting microbial contamination and to prevent future accumulation. Ready to use and formulated without harsh chemicals, ICX products are an easy, effective way to maintain your dental unit waterlines and equipment—protecting your investment. ICX Waterline Treatment Tablets: Easy to Use The effervescing ICX formula does the work for you, preventing the accumulation of odor and foul-tasting bacteria. Simply add one tablet to an empty self-contained water bottle before each filling. ICX continues working in the system with each treatment, protecting the waterlines from further contamination and reducing the need for frequent shock treatments. Maintains dental unit waterline effluent ≤ 10 CFU/mL Eliminates odor and foul-tasting bacteria Reduces buildup of deposits Continuously present in water as a preventive, proactive solution Remains active in water up to two weeks during periods of equipment nonuse Eliminates the need to purge waterlines at night Compatible for use with restorative bonding materials Gentle on your dental equipment New ICX Renew Shock Treatment: Fast-Acting Fast-acting ICX Renew liquid shock treatment removes odor and foul-tasting bacteria in dental unit waterlines. Just mix the two solutions together into an empty water bottle, run through the lines, and soak overnight. After completing the shock treatment, flush the lines with water and resume your regular use. Penetrates and removes the buildup of odor and foul-tasting bacteria Blue color lets you know the solution is hard at work in the waterlines Non-corrosive and gentle on equipment Will not corrode or clog waterlines Odorless formula Not available in California. Maintain. Monitor. Shock. Three Steps to Clean. Along with a daily waterline maintenance protocol, it's important to monitor water quality and periodically shock the lines to clear deposits and contamination. These three steps help maintain your dental unit waterlines. Maintain waterlines with the daily use of ICX to prevent accumulation of odor and foul-tasting bacteria. Regularly monitor dental unit water quality using a water monitoring test kit or laboratory services. Use ICX Renew to shock the waterlines whenever waterline bacteria levels exceed your established water quality action level.

Intended for use with potable water, ICX remains active in the system for up to two weeks. Can ICX be used in patient's mouths? ICX has been formulated to be used in water used for dental treatment and thus may be used in a patient's mouth. Does ICX comply with the 2017 EPA Effluent Limitations Guideline? The EPA published an FAQ that clarified confusion regarding which waterlines, and thus associated line cleaners, are subject to the guideline. Based on this clarification, the rule does not apply to ICX as ICX is used in supply waterlines. See the EPA FAQ for more information. Can ICX be used in oral surgery procedures? The CDC recommends the use of sterile irrigating solutions and devices designed for delivering sterile irrigating fluids for oral surgery procedures. ICX does not create sterile water and thus is not intended for use during oral surgery. ICX Renew FAQs Application Each ICX Renew application contains two bottles. Do I use both bottles to treat my dental unit? Yes, combine the entire contents from Solution 1 and Solution 2 in the dental unit water bottle immediately before treating your unit. Do not premix the two bottles to store for later use. How frequently should I use ICX Renew? Before you use new equipment for the first time, apply one treatment. For existing equipment, when water quality test results exceed your water quality action level apply three treatments on successive days. You may use the dental unit between treatments. Water Quality Testing What is the recommended dental unit water quality action level? Guidelines or requirements for dental unit water quality vary by region and are usually specified in colony forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml). A-dec recommends an action level based on the quality guidelines in your region. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended guideline is ≤ 500 CFU/ml heterotrophic water bacteria. If guidelines or requirements are not available in your region, A-dec recommends 500 CFU/ml as an action level. How frequently should I test my dental unit water quality? The frequency of water quality testing depends on your water quality goal. A-dec recommends initially testing once per month. If monthly results pass your clinic's water quality goals for three successive months, reduce the testing frequency to once every three months. Water quality should be monitored by performing a test that provides a quantitative measurement of heterotrophic bacteria. How do I test my dental unit water quality? A-dec recommends using either an in-office water quality test kit or a water quality testing service that provides a quantitative measurement of heterotrophic bacteria. Dental Unit Waterlines to Treat Which dental unit waterlines should be treated with ICX Renew? Perform the shock treatment in all air/water syringe and handpiece waterlines that use water within the delivery unit and assistant instrumentation. This includes air/water syringe, ultrasonic scalers, and handpiece waterlines on units that are not currently being used. Treatment Guidelines How long should ICX Renew be left in dental unit waterlines? ICX Renew should remain in your dental unit for a minimum of 12 but no longer than 96 hours. See the ICX Renew Instructions for Use for more information on adjusting the application time. Is it necessary to remove the handpieces, motors, and couplers before applying ICX Renew? Yes. Remove air/water syringe tips, handpieces, detachable motors and couplers, and ultrasonic instruments from their tubing before adding the solution into the empty water bottle. Clean, disinfect, and sterilize these instruments according to the manufacturer's instructions. Can I use the vacuum system (HVE/SE) to flush ICX Renew from the waterlines? No, you must flush ICX Renew into a sink or cuspidor attached to municipal drain. Optimal Infection Control Learn how A-dec dental equipment is engineered with a focus on asepsis.

Downloads Product Literature Mechanical Room Brochure Support Documents A-dec SC Air Compressor Instructions for Use FAQs Can I run a mill with an A-dec compressor? There are certain mill units that are compatible with the A-dec compressor, such as the E4D/Planmill along with others that require a low volume of air at normal dental pressure settings. Please check with A-dec Customer Service for compatibility. There are other mills that require much larger volumes of air at higher than normal PSI minimums that are normal in dental operation. These mill motor systems are often driven by air vs. electricity creating greater demand. Traditional dental compressors found in the market today were not designed for these mills. While PSI can often be adjusted up, these compressors must work much longer to accommodate the long mill operating times, sometimes lasting over 1 hour. Most all dental compressors are rated with a particular duty cycle that is not compatible with these longer run time demands. Duty cycle refers to the start/stop normal operation a compressor needs to cool down between run times. This duty cycle % should be published by the manufacturer. For example, a 50% duty cycle may be rated on a particular compressor. Exceeding the manufacturer's recommended duty cycle will lead to premature failure in the compressor. What am I able to stack to maximize my space in the mechanical room? You are able to stack an A-dec vacuum on an A-dec SC3, SC5, or SC7 air compressor. You also are able to stack an A-dec SC3, SC5, or SC7 air compressor on top of another SC3, SC5, SC7 compressor. You are unable to stack anything on an A-dec SC10 or SC12 compressor. What is the operating PSI range of the A-dec compressor? The operating PSI for A-dec compressors is 86 to 106 PSI. What maintenance does the mechanical room equipment need? The A-dec dry vacuums and A-dec oil-free air compressors need a service kit once a year. The compressor needs the dryer media replaced every 5 years. Upgradeable and expandable design.

Sleek silhouette. The slim profile is easy to incorporate into any operatory or practice space. JADE Doesn't Just Filter Pollutants, It Deactivates Them Learn more about the science and technology behind clean, energized air. Pre-Filter Powered by a large volume airflow, the pre-filter stage catches the largest particles in the room as air is drawn through the intake chamber at the bottom of the unit. HEPA-Rx Filter The HEPA-Rx filter captures 99.2% of ultrafine particles 0.0025 microns in size—and 99.998% of particles of 0.1 microns in size (that's just 1/250,000 of an inch!). Activated Carbon Filter The activated carbon filter absorbs volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including noxious odors, chemicals and gases. Germicidal UV-C+ Light The high-intensity germicidal UV-C+ light works with the TiO2 catalyst to rupture the DNA of viruses and bacteria. TiO2 Catalyst The titanium dioxide catalyst works with the germicidal UV-C+ light, releasing the electrons at the catalyst surface. These electrons interact with water molecules to create hydroxyl radicals, which further attack pollutants, breaking apart their chemical bonds. Revitalizing Negative Ion Chamber Before the pure, clean air is released back into the room, it's revitalized with negative ions. Studies have shown that negative ions increase the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in higher alertness, decreased drowsiness, and more mental energy*. *“Treating Depression with Atypical Symptoms Using Negative Air Ions at High Density,” Michael Terman, PhD, Columbia University, New York Capture Deactivate Re-energize Maintaining Your JADE Air Purifier For optimum performance, the HEPA-Rx filter, the activated carbon filter and the germicidal UV-C+ bulb should be replaced when the corresponding indicator lights are flashing. Typically, you'll replace the HEPA-Rx filter and germicidal UV-C+ bulb once a year, and the activated carbon filter twice a year. Changing a JADE filter or bulb takes less than two minutes—and no special tools are needed. Purchasing replacements from your authorized A-dec dealer will ensure that you continue using ultrafine particulate HEPA filters that perform to H13-H14 standards, and UV-C bulbs that are 'zero ozone emission products,' which emit ozone less than 0.005 ppm (5 ppb). JADE Air Purifier Placement Downloads Product Literature JADE Air Purifier Brochure Support Documents JADE Air Purifier Operation Manual Safety Data Sheets (SDS) Safety Data Sheets (SDS) FAQs How will I know if JADE is actually removing contaminants from the air? Real-time monitoring displays give you the peace of mind of knowing JADE is performing at its best. While air purification is generally an invisible operation, clients say they notice the difference after installing JADE. The air seems fresher and lighter, and they see less dust on furniture, floors and fixtures. You'll see how well your JADE is working when you clean the pre-filter, which is often black with dirt even from rooms with air that seems relatively clean. How much noise does JADE make? The JADE Air Purifier is one of the quietest commercial-grade systems on the market today. The unique sound-dampening design allows JADE to operate at decibel levels lower than a normal conversation—even on the highest setting. Low Speed <40 dB(A) Medium Speed 43 dB(A) High Speed 48 dB(A) Turbo Speed 55 dB(A) Normal conversation 60 dB(A) How much electricity does JADE use? Surprisingly little! Running the JADE Air Purifier is equivalent to using a 60W light bulb. What’s the difference between lower-priced air purifiers and JADE? In general, the cheaper the unit the less sophisticated its filtration system and the lower its air flow movement—both of which drastically reduce air cleaning efficiency. Other major issues with low-cost units are increased noise, reduced reliability, fewer technologies, higher operating costs, difficulties in finding replacement filters, and in some cases, off-gassing or ozone production. Can I leave JADE on all the time? Yes. JADE is designed and built for continuous air cleaning. We encourage customers to leave at least one JADE running at all times. Adjust the airflow based on the level of cleaning you desire; the higher the airflow, the ""cleaner"" your indoor air will be. What does the number on the display panel show? Micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter (PM2.5 is short for ""fine inhalable particles with diameters 2.5 micrometers and smaller."") The number can spike due to activity around the unit—in a high-traffic area, it can reach the 20s or higher. A reading of 000 means the level of PM2.5 is below 1 microgram per cubic meter. (The actual level is likely around 0.3 to 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter, but JADE cannot display decimal points, so it rounds the value up or down to the nearest whole number.) What does the colored light indicate? When JADE displays the orange or red light, it is sensing a spike in VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) or particulate (aerosols). These are often created after using cleaning supplies/disinfectants or from aerosols produced during dental procedures. Don't be alarmed by an orange or red light; it will return to green once the VOCs or particulates are cleared from the air and levels return to normal. Why does JADE have a Negative Ion function? It's an extra benefit beyond clean, purified air! General scientific understanding suggests that negative ions increase the flow of oxygen to the brain, which results in more mental energy, decreased drowsiness, and higher mental alertness. Will JADE alter the temperature or humidity of my indoor environment? Not directly, as JADE has no heating, cooling, or water components. However, it does circulate the air within a room which can have some indirect positive effects on indoor temperature and humidity. Does JADE emit ozone? JADE qualifies as a ""zero ozone emission product"" which means it demonstrates emissions of less than 0.005 ppm (5 ppb), which is below the quantifiable level for ozone testing. This is lower than the permitted 0.05 ppm (50 ppb) under test standard UL 867 (US), and 0.02 ppm (20 ppb) under test standard CSA 22.2 (Canada). Are JADE air purifiers safety certified? Yes. JADE is independently lab tested and certified to be in compliance with UL standard 867 and CSA standard C22.2 No. 187-M1986 by ETL, and bears the ETL and CETL mark under report No. 3035728.005.

A-dec,icx-restore,A-dec,icx-restore,ICX and ICX Restore. Simple. Effective. Affordable. (Canada Only)," ICX and ICX Restore. Simple. Effective. Affordable. (Canada Only) Patients trust that the water you're using in their oral cavity is of the highest quality. To ensure this, dental unit waterlines must be carefully and consistently maintained. The A-dec line of ICX products helps simplify your waterline cleaning routine. ICX waterline treatment tablets and new ICX Restore waterline shock treatment work together to remove contamination in dental unit waterlines and to prevent future accumulation. Ready to use and formulated without harsh chemicals, ICX products are an easy, effective way to maintain your dental unit waterlines and equipment—protecting your investment. ICX Waterline Treatment Tablets: Easy to Use The effervescing ICX formula does the work for you, preventing the accumulation of odor and foul-tasting bacteria. Simply add one tablet to an empty self-contained water bottle before each filling. ICX continues working in the system with each treatment, protecting the waterlines from further contamination and reducing the need for frequent shock treatments. Maintains dental unit waterline effluent ≤ 10 CFU/mL Eliminates odor and foul-tasting bacteria Reduces buildup of deposits Continuously present in water as a preventive, proactive solution Remains active in water up to two weeks during periods of equipment nonuse Eliminates the need to purge waterlines at night Compatible for use with restorative bonding materials Gentle on your dental equipment New ICX Restore Shock Treatment: Fast-Acting Fast-acting ICX Restore liquid shock treatment removes contamination in dental unit waterlines. Just mix the two solutions together into an empty water bottle, run through the lines, and soak overnight. After completing the shock treatment, flush the lines with water and resume your regular use. Penetrates and removes contamination Blue color lets you know the solution is hard at work in the waterlines Non-corrosive and gentle on equipment Will not corrode or clog waterlines Odorless formula ICX Restore is available in Canada only. Maintain. Monitor. Shock. Three Steps to Clean. Along with a daily waterline maintenance protocol, it's important to monitor water quality and periodically shock the lines to clear deposits and contamination. These three steps help maintain your dental unit waterlines. Maintain waterlines with the daily use of ICX to reduce build-up of deposits. Regularly monitor dental unit water quality using a water monitoring test kit or laboratory services. Use ICX Restore to shock the waterlines whenever waterline contamination levels exceed your established water quality action level. Download the ICX & ICX Restore Dental Waterline Treatment Brochure for additional details. Downloads Product Literature A-dec ICX & ICX Restore Dental Waterline Treatment Brochure Technical Bulletin - Cleaning Performance of ICX Restore Dental Unit Waterline Shock Treatment Support Documents A-dec ICX Restore Instructions for Use A-dec Waterline Maintenance Guide ICX FAQs How long does ICX last in the water bottle or system? Intended for use with potable water, ICX remains active in the system for up to two weeks. Can ICX be used in patient's mouths? ICX has been formulated to be used in water used for dental treatment and thus may be used in a patient's mouth. Does ICX comply with the 2017 EPA Effluent Limitations Guideline? The EPA published an FAQ that clarified confusion regarding which waterlines, and thus associated line cleaners, are subject to the guideline. Based on this clarification, the rule does not apply to ICX as ICX is used in supply waterlines. See the EPA FAQ for more information. Can ICX be used in oral surgery procedures? The CDC recommends the use of sterile irrigating solutions and devices designed for delivering sterile irrigating fluids for oral surgery procedures. ICX does not create sterile water and thus is not intended for use during oral surgery. ICX Restore FAQs Application Each ICX Restore application contains two bottles. Do I use both bottles to treat my dental unit? Yes, combine the entire contents from Solution 1 and Solution 2 in the dental unit water bottle immediately before treating your unit. Do not premix the two bottles to store for later use. How frequently should I use ICX Restore? Before you use new equipment for the first time, apply one treatment. For existing equipment, apply three treatments on successive days when water quality test results exceed your water quality action level. You may use the dental unit between treatments. For proactive preventive maintenance, apply one treatment per unit on a routine basis, such as quarterly. Water Quality Testing What is the recommended dental unit water quality action level? Guidelines or requirements for dental unit water quality vary by region and are usually specified in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). A-dec recommends an action level based on the quality guidelines in your region. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended guideline is ≤ 500 CFU/ml heterotrophic water bacteria. If guidelines or requirements are not available in your region, A-dec recommends 500 CFU/ml as an action level. How frequently should I test my dental unit water quality? The frequency of water quality testing depends on your clinic’s water quality goal. A-dec recommends initially testing once per month. If monthly results pass your water quality goals for three successive months, reduce the testing frequency to once every three months. Water quality should be monitored by performing a test that provides a quantitative measurement of heterotrophic bacteria. How do I test my dental unit water quality? A-dec recommends using either an in-office water quality test kit or a water quality testing service that provides a quantitative measurement of heterotrophic bacteria. Dental Unit Waterlines to Treat Which dental unit waterlines should be treated with ICX Restore? Perform the shock treatment in all air/water syringe and handpiece waterlines that use water within the delivery unit and assistant instrumentation. This includes air/water syringe, ultrasonic scalers, and handpiece waterlines on units that are not currently being used. Treatment Guidelines How long should ICX Restore be left in dental unit waterlines? ICX Restore should remain in your dental unit for a minimum of 12 but no longer than 96 hours. See the A-dec Waterline Maintenance Guide and the ICX Restore Instructions for Use for more information on adjusting the application time. Is it necessary to remove the handpieces, motors, and couplers before applying ICX Restore? Yes. Remove air/water syringe tips, handpieces, detachable motors and couplers, and ultrasonic instruments from their tubing before adding the solution into the empty water bottle. Reprocess these instruments according to the manufacturer's instructions. Can I use the vacuum system (HVE/SE) to flush ICX Restore from the waterlines? No, flush ICX Restore into a sink or cuspidor attached to the municipal drain.
