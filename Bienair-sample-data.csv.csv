Bienair,Evo.15,Bienair,Evo.15,EVO.15 1:5,"Designed for Today’s Challenges.  The all-new contra-angle EVO.15 is one a kind, simultaneously raising performance standards and revolutionizing patient safety. This promising handpiece combines Swiss precision with an unparalleled level of durability and ergonomics. Discover what makes the contra-angle EVO.15 the indispensable dental instrument, day in and day out.


 Ultimate Precision for Durable Performance.  Accurate. High efficiency and cutting-edge technology come together on the contra-angle EVO.15. The new Accu-Chuck PreciPlus™ bur-retention and rotation drive mechanism is a perfect example of that – its vibration-canceling properties not only reduce noise interference, they also authorize perfect stability and accuracy no matter the speed and torque. Due to durability being a key contributor to performance, the contra-angle EVO.15 is fitted with a bespoke rotor’s head that demonstrates significantly longer service life than conventional models. The most advanced engineering techniques, skilled company know-how, and up to 3 years of warranty put in your hands the quality and reliability our competitors have been trying to match for almost 60 years.
 Where Efficient Meets Easy.  Practical. The size of the contra-angle EVO.15 makes you forget that you are handling such a high-performance instrument. Its small, shockproof stainless steel head provides remarkable maneuverability and accessibility to third molars. As part of Bien-Air’s Micro-Series line, the handpiece’s comparatively lighter weight pushes the limits of comfort even further with more balanced manipulation and reduced hand and wrist fatigue. To maximize user experience, every aspect of the contra-angle EVO.15 has been carefully thought-out. The improved Accu-Spray Quattro Mix™ and its dualook™ non-dazzling multi-strand optical glass system support this statement and need to be credited for competent operative field cooling and reliable intraoral visibility.
 The Confidence You Have Your Patients’ Trust.  Safe. The contra-angle EVO.15 expresses itself in multiple ways, and patient safety is unmistakably at the forefront. Bien-Air’s patented CoolTouch+™ heat-arresting technology brings the handpiece closer to zero risk when it comes to patient burn injuries. Similarly, adverse events linked to bur slippage are prevented, thanks to an extremely efficient fastening system. When brought together, these combined safety features make the contra-angle EVO.15 the safest electric handpiece ever designed.

Bienair,1600436-001,Bienair,1600436-001,PM 1:2,"A best seller in oral maxillofacial surgery, the PM 1:2 is the epitome of what Bien-Air’s Swiss precision brings to uncompromised quality and reliability. Newly improved infection control features position this straight handpiece at the forefront of patient safety and, in turn, afford it with significantly prolonged service life. With Bien-Air’s PM 1:2, confidently dispose of all uncertainties and get ready to outperform yourself.
Safe and Durable.Aside from its primary function of thoroughly cooling the operative field, the PM 1:2’s external irrigation system – with sterile disposable tubing – complies with the highest hygiene standards in oral surgery.

Bienair,1700486-001,Bienair,1700486-001,OPTIMA,"OptimaINT and its MX2 and MCX micromotors guarantee perfect control of the tool, managing the speed, torque and reversal of the direction of rotation. Providing the ultimate speed and torque control, the Optima INT and DMX control units with Smart Logic technology are capable of exploiting to the fullest the outstanding capacities of the MX micromotors.
Thanks to its Easy-Nav philosophy, the Optima INT is incredibly intuitive and adapts to most dental chairs. It is ideal if you want to upgrade your pneumatic chair to bring it into the electronic age. Quite simply, it offers the best Swiss engineering. OptimaINT is particularly versatile.


This control unit offers pre-programmed modes for all the main restorative operations and for endodontics. A true all-in-one system, it also makes your life simpler: two contra-angle handpieces are sufficient to perform the vast majority of dentistry operations. This results in improved comfort as well as a time saving.
The OptimaINT interface has 10 preprogrammed sequences for endodontic operations and 10 sequences for restorative operations. You can perform your root treatments in complete safety. The OptimaINT has been designed to reduce the risk of NiTi instrument breakage to a minimum, by means of the auto-reverse function. Your distributor-installer is able to upgrade your electric or airpowered unit to brushless sensorless technology. This will allow you to combine a high-performance tool with your usual unit control.

Bienair,1700386-001,Bienair,1700386-001,OPTIMA,"OptimaINT and its MX2 and MCX micromotors guarantee perfect control of the tool, managing the speed, torque and reversal of the direction of rotation. Providing the ultimate speed and torque control, the Optima INT and DMX control units with Smart Logic technology are capable of exploiting to the fullest the outstanding capacities of the MX micromotors.
Thanks to its Easy-Nav philosophy, the Optima INT is incredibly intuitive and adapts to most dental chairs. It is ideal if you want to upgrade your pneumatic chair to bring it into the electronic age. Quite simply, it offers the best Swiss engineering. OptimaINT is particularly versatile.


This control unit offers pre-programmed modes for all the main restorative operations and for endodontics. A true all-in-one system, it also makes your life simpler: two contra-angle handpieces are sufficient to perform the vast majority of dentistry operations. This results in improved comfort as well as a time saving.
The OptimaINT interface has 10 preprogrammed sequences for endodontic operations and 10 sequences for restorative operations. You can perform your root treatments in complete safety. The OptimaINT has been designed to reduce the risk of NiTi instrument breakage to a minimum, by means of the auto-reverse function. Your distributor-installer is able to upgrade your electric or airpowered unit to brushless sensorless technology. This will allow you to combine a high-performance tool with your usual unit control.

Bienair,1600755-001,Bienair,1600755-001,MX-i LED,"These are the most powerful implantology micromotors on the market. With their Chiropro L, iChiropro, Chiropro 3rd Gen and Chiropro PLUS 3rd Gen control units, MX-i LED micromotors are redefining standards in implantology. MX-i LED micromotors are first and foremost a model of stability. At both high and low speeds, they offer enhanced working comfort and their high torque copes with the most complex implant insertion procedures. Depending on the desired speed, the power is constantly adapted in order to provide the optimum result. This is thanks to Smart Logic technology. MX-i LED micromotors are available in two different versions adapted to suit the user's needs: non-self-cooled for implantology procedures, and self-cooled for implantology procedures and oral surgery. Finally, MX-i LED micromotors are equipped with adjustable LED lighting, providing the contra-angle handpiece with intense, natural and constant light at both high and low speeds. Not only are MX-i LED micromotors the most powerful implantology micromotors on the market, they are also the most robust. 3-year warranty.Technical Data

Bienair,Evo.15-1,Bienair,Evo.15-1,EVO.15 1:1,"Designed for Today’s Challenges.  The all-new contra-angle EVO.15 is one a kind, simultaneously raising performance standards and revolutionizing patient safety. This promising handpiece combines Swiss precision with an unparalleled level of durability and ergonomics. Discover what makes the contra-angle EVO.15 the indispensable dental instrument, day in and day out.


 Ultimate Precision for Durable Performance.  Accurate. High efficiency and cutting-edge technology come together on the contra-angle EVO.15. The new Accu-Chuck PreciPlus™ bur-retention and rotation drive mechanism is a perfect example of that – its vibration-canceling properties not only reduce noise interference, they also authorize perfect stability and accuracy no matter the speed and torque.
Due to durability being a key contributor to performance, the contra-angle EVO.15 is fitted with a bespoke rotor’s head that demonstrates significantly longer service life than conventional models. The most advanced engineering techniques, skilled company know-how, and up to 3 years of warranty put in your hands the quality and reliability our competitors have been trying to match for almost 60 years.
 Where Efficient Meets Easy.  Practical. The size of the contra-angle EVO.15 makes you forget that you are handling such a high-performance instrument. Its small, shockproof stainless steel head provides remarkable maneuverability and accessibility to third molars. As part of Bien-Air’s Micro-Series line, the handpiece’s comparatively lighter weight pushes the limits of comfort even further with more balanced manipulation and reduced hand and wrist fatigue. To maximize user experience, every aspect of the contra-angle EVO.15 has been carefully thought-out. The improved Accu-Spray Quattro Mix™ and its dualook™ non-dazzling multi-strand optical glass system support this statement and need to be credited for competent operative field cooling and reliable intraoral visibility.
