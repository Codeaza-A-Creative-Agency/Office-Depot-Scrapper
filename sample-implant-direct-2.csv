The added drill color coding makes identification and organization of drills easier. The color-coding matches the surgical kit and the implant vial label
The new short DLC drills have longer flutes as well as 11.5mm and 13mm depth marks to enable placement of implants up to 13mm in length
The Diamond-Like Carbon Coating (DLC) is a coating process that enhances the wear resistance of biomedical components while maintaining low friction and bioinertial properties
Within the DLC drill line, there are four different hub sizes that vary by diameter to minimize the hub width and reduce the possibility of interference
The DLC drill hub provides a secure fit for Implant Direct Drill Stops to attach, aligning with preset Drill Stop diameters
DLC drills are indicated for drilling up to 30 osteotomies per drill at a recommended maximum of 1200RPM
The overall length of the long DLC Drills (6-16mmL) is 36.6mm and the overall length of the short DLC Drills (6-13mmL) is 30.6mm
DLC drills are made of stainless-steel meeting the ASTM A564 standard

Legacy implants have demonstrated excellent clinical success, including primary stability, minimal osseous changes in the short and intermediate time frames, a stable interface, and no loose final abutment over a five-year period3

Internal hex connection (1.5mm long hex and internal lead-in bevel)
Color-coded prosthetic interface for clear visual indication of interface size
Straight/tapered implant body design
Three cutting grooves, no bone taps required
Quadruple-lead micro-threads on coronal aspect designed to increase bone-implant contact (BIC) and long-term stability in crestal bone area
Progressively-deeper buttress threads designed for increased BIC and improved primary stability
Fixture-mount functions as a closed-tray transfer
Fixture-mount features a flat to match the flat on the internal-hex, making indexing easier
Color-coded fixture-mount top matches implant prosthetic platform/interface
Made in the USA from medical-grade titanium alloy
