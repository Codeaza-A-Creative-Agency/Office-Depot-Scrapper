The EOS suction system-Aerosols and Droplets annihilator is designed and engineered to reduce droplet and aerosol spray that is an innate part of dental care. During dental procedures, Droplets and Aerosols are passed on to the dentist and staff's bodies. Patient care and the safety and health of the staff and the dentist is paramount, for the elimination of blood, aerosols and fine liquid particles. All of which are annihilated by the ADS EOS extraoral dental suction system.The ADS EOS extraoral dental suction system collects aerosols, droplets, dust and pathogens produced during routine dental procedures through a suction mouthpiece hood. Particulate matter is filtrated by the dust/particulate filter. The HEPA filter captures particles down to 0.3 microns with 99.995% efficiency. Clean dry air is exhausted from the base cabinet. The UVC lights are positioned on the HEPA filter and kill any remaining bacteria and viruses captured by the HEPA filter and are exhausted from the cabinet base. In ISO16890, European standard EN 1822:2009, EN 779:2012 and  DOE-STD-3020-2015. Specification for HEPA Filters Used by DOE Contractors, all mention HEPA filter H14 is a medical-grade filter that filters a minimum of 99.97% particles @ 0.3 microns (PM 0.3) or larger. With our special module design in the EOS Extraoral Suction System, fine filter, suction motor, UV light and HEPA filter are tightly buckled together into one metal module which is well sealed, this reliable structure helps to trap the dirty air inside, will not be leaked. In the article from CDC infection control online, mention the HEPA filter must be well sealed, a wooden or metal frame is required, a metal frame is much better. The ADS dental suction system is using a metal frame for a HEPA filter.Buy dental instruments at ADS and contact us now!
