DenMat,OPCMLT6,DenMat,OPCMLT6,Medicated Lip Treatment - 6 Piece,"Developed by a dentist for his patients, this clear, lightweight gel fights germs to keep lips healthy when used on a daily basis and helps speed the healing of cold sores during outbreaks.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), up to 80% of adults have the virus that causes cold sores, which can be triggered by a number of conditions such as stress, sun exposure, or trauma (including during dental procedures). Cold sores are often made worse by opportunistic germs that infect them and contribute to blistering and pain. Our powerful antibacterial formula fights these germs, to relieve symptoms and promote healing.
Benefits:

Reduces unwanted bacteria to maintain health of lips
Protects lips from germs that can worsen cold sores
Clear, lightweight gel
