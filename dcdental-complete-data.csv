composites, amalgams, and other cement materials. Unlike other bases/liners,
Bio-LCB provides superior strength, bonds to dentin, and promotes dentin
remineralization. The proprietary UDMA-based formulation forms calcium
hydroxide upon curing which results in an increase in pH. This action protects
the pulp, stimulating pulpal cells to form dentin and decreases the risk of
secondary decay. This unique composition also contains remineralizing agents
which are released upon setting to form hydroxyapatite and further aid in the
remineralization of the surrounding dentition.  
  
Advanced Features Include:

  * Bonds to dentin to prevent bacterial leakage and secondary decay
  * Promotes reparative dentin remineralization
  * Strong mechanical shock absorbing protection - bonds to dentin and restorative materials
  * Low polymerization shrinkage

agent which combines etch, primer and adhesive into a single component for
ease of application.

neither etch the dentin or to wash it off. Once cured, you can immediately
place your restorative. You can't over dry or over etch when using Prolink SE.
Therefore, post-operative sensitivity will not occur. Prolink SE's low film
thickness provides an invisible margin between the restoration and the tooth.  
  
Features:

  * 7th Generation
  * Excellent bond with dentin and enamel
  * Excellent bond with any self-cured, visible light-cured or dual-cured composites
  * Quick and Easy solution, maximizing patient comfort

office water line or it sreservoir for irrigation during the procedure. iVac
piezo is a multifunctional device that can be used for dental hygiene;
extensively evidence-based and proven to be effective for calculus and stain
removal, alongside applications in endodontics, periodontics, cavity
preparation, implantology, and oral surgery. iVac piezo utilizes a state-of-
the-art piezoelectric transducer operating at an optimal frequency of 27 kHz
to 31 kHz in a linear pattern via crystals activated by the ceramic handpiece.
iVac piezo requires less water to control heat compared with magnetostrictive
ultrasonic handpieces. This specific property produces fewer aerosols during
scaling and is more comfortable for patients with breathing conditions. In
addition, with an advanced processor-controlled energy dispersion at the
various inserts designs available, iVac piezo electronics manage the necessary
vibration for each procedure, allowing more comfort and less aerosol during
vibration.

  * It can effectively clean and disinfect irregularities of the root canal system with the action of continuous ultrasonic irrigation,4, 5, 6
  * The polymer microcannula allows effective ultrasonic activation7 of the irrigant, even in curved canals.

DC Dental, 100-9542LTA ," Pac-Dent, Inc. ", 100-9542LTA ,iVac Irrigation System Long Silicone Tubing and Connectors 1/Pk,"The iVac™ System is designed to be used during the root canal treatment
irrigation phase, preferably connected to a piezo ultrasonic handpiece. The
system was created using the three most important concepts established by the
endodontic research and science for root canal irrigation and disinfection.  
  
Advantages:

  * The iVac™ uses apical negative pressure with concomitant irrigation, which avoids the risk of extrusion of the irrigant while allowing the irrigating fluid to clean and disinfect the entire root canal to the working length1, 2.
  * iVac™ is highly instrumental in cases where irrigation depth control is essential3, such as young teeth, apexification, regeneration, and apical foramen resorptions.
