Providing the ultimate speed and torque control, the Optima INT and DMX control units with Smart Logic technology are capable of exploiting to the fullest the outstanding capacities of the MX micromotors.Thanks to its Easy-Nav philosophy, the Optima INT is incredibly intuitive and adapts to most dental chairs. It is ideal if you want to upgrade your pneumatic chair to bring it into the electronic age. Quite simply, it offers the best Swiss engineering. OptimaINT is particularly versatile.This control unit offers pre-programmed modes for all the main restorative operations and for endodontics. A true all-in-one system, it also makes your life simpler: two contra-angle handpieces are sufficient to perform the vast majority of dentistry operations. This results in improved comfort as well as a time saving.The OptimaINT interface has 10 preprogrammed sequences for endodontic operations and 10 sequences for restorative operations. You can perform your root treatments in complete safety. The OptimaINT has been designed to reduce the risk of NiTi instrument breakage to a minimum, by means of the auto-reverse function. Your distributor-installer is able to upgrade your electric or airpowered unit to brushless sensorless technology. This will allow you to combine a high-performance tool with your usual unit control.Learn MoreAn integral part of the OPTIMA system, the last generation MCX-LED motor features brushless technology for superlative performance in both high- and lowspeed procedures.The MCX micromotor and Micro-Series contra-angle are no larger than a turbine. This reduction in size ensures perfect balance by greatly reducing the effort required to hold the handpiece. Ensuring less fatigue at the end of the day.Bien-Air CA 1:1 L and 1:5 L Micro-Series contra-angles are perfect for all high and low speed procedures. Vibrations and noise are cut in half while providing the additional benefit of constant speed.Reference:OPTIMA MCX INT1700486-001",,,"

						equipped with CoolTouch+™ heat-arresting technology. Efficiency Forward. 					","Designed for Today’s Challenges.The all-new contra-angle EVO.15 is one a kind, simultaneously raising performance standards and revolutionizing patient safety. This promising handpiece combines Swiss precision with an unparalleled level of durability and ergonomics. Discover what makes the contra-angle EVO.15 the indispensable dental instrument, day in and day out.Ultimate Precision for Durable Performance.Accurate. High efficiency and cutting-edge technology come together on the contra-angle EVO.15. The new Accu-Chuck PreciPlus™ bur-retention and rotation drive mechanism is a perfect example of that – its vibration-canceling properties not only reduce noise interference, they also authorize perfect stability and accuracy no matter the speed and torque. Due to durability being a key contributor to performance, the contra-angle EVO.15 is fitted with a bespoke rotor’s head that demonstrates significantly longer service life than conventional models. The most advanced engineering techniques, skilled company know-how, and up to 3 years of warranty put in your hands the quality and reliability our competitors have been trying to match for almost 60 years.Where Efficient Meets Easy.Practical. The size of the contra-angle EVO.15 makes you forget that you are handling such a high-performance instrument. Its small, shockproof stainless steel head provides remarkable maneuverability and accessibility to third molars. As part of Bien-Air’s Micro-Series line, the handpiece’s comparatively lighter weight pushes the limits of comfort even further with more balanced manipulation and reduced hand and wrist fatigue. To maximize user experience, every aspect of the contra-angle EVO.15 has been carefully thought-out. The improved Accu-Spray Quattro Mix™ and its dualook™ non-dazzling multi-strand optical glass system support this statement and need to be credited for competent operative field cooling and reliable intraoral visibility.The Confidence You Have Your Patients’ Trust.Safe. The contra-angle EVO.15 expresses itself in multiple ways, and patient safety is unmistakably at the forefront. Bien-Air’s patented CoolTouch+™ heat-arresting technology brings the handpiece closer to zero risk when it comes to patient burn injuries. Similarly, adverse events linked to bur slippage are prevented, thanks to an extremely efficient fastening system. When brought together, these combined safety features make the contra-angle EVO.15 the safest electric handpiece ever designed.* 2-year standard warranty and 1-year optional warranty available throughBien-Air's PlanCare extended warranty program.Learn MoreIn dental procedures making use of electric handpieces, the briefest contact between the instrument's push-button and the patient's inner-cheek causes the former to overheat, resulting in possible burn injuries. While the latter's increasing frequency is keeping public health agencies on high alert, industry-wide safety regulations are yet to be formulated.Bien-Air’s new generation Micro-Series models ally innovation with compact design, resulting in improved power and maneuverability. Up to 30% shorter and 23% lighter than traditional models, they have an easy grasp that allows for optimal work comfort with less strain on the hand, arm, and shoulder.This revolutionary technology assures a staunch clamping of the bur, eliminating all vibrations, and granting the handpiece unequaled stability and comfort for the most precise dental work.
